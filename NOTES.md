- need a postgres db
- images go into postgres db
- picocss / htmx app does stuff with API -> let's start with just an image polling solution
- once image polling works we want:
  -- display images

- ## ok I have basic stuff, now I need-- app polls for images-- discord app stores image links into database

- ok so i have images. now i need to handle upscaling (via parsing replies)
- create new collection
- search through collection
- search through all images

- why not just use channels instead of having internal management of collections?
- once you have an image, need to track upscales
- search

-->

ok switched to channels.

now need to handle image upscaling
search

OK in order:

- Handle ingestion (from channels)
- Handle image upscales (ingestion)
- Make it look nice
