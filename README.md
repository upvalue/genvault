# genvault

genvault is a tool for working with text & image generative AIs.

It is a minimalistic interface for some text & image models. It's intended to
augment an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, though it's not inherently
tied to Obsidian and can be used without it.

Currently supports:

- Generating images with Stable Diffusion via [Replicate](https://replicate.com)

Todo:

- Midjourney
- ChatGPT via OpenAI API
- Llama2 via some API

All of these are saved to Markdown files with properties so they can be easily
searched from Obsidian, linked to from other Obsidian notes & canvases and so
on.

# Setup

TBD
